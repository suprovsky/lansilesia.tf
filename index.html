      <h1 class="display-4 font-weight-normal">What is PoLANd?</h1>
      <p>
        PoLANd is an event for competetive-minded Team Fortress 2 players
        The main idea of the event is to integrate the polish TF2 community and to have some fun playing pickups in one's
        favourite mode (either 6v6 or 9v9 - highlander), participating in MGE tournament or many others (more info on that soon).
        Thanks to that, we present you with a possibility of meeting your internet friends from the game in person.

      </p>
      <p>
        Participation in the event requires an admission fee: for adults it amounts to 220 PLN, whereas for minor the feee is 165 PLN.
However, coming over and simply spectating is free.
        The event is mainly targeted at 18+ audience. There is, however, a possibility for minors to participate, as long as
        they are under supervision of a legal guardian.

      </p>
      <p>
        PoLANd is the first event organised by us, where the participants are able to rent a PC.
        We have organised in the past five different events, though. Thanks to the experience we have gathered so far,
        we are able to provide an elevated kind of LAN experience.
        The previous events have taken place in Katowice, but this time we are moving over to the very heart of Poland: Łódź.
        The event is scheduled for July 15-17, 2022 at a place called BaseStack.gg

      <h1 class="display-4 font-weight-normal">Double mixes? Pickups? MGEsilesia? What is going on here?</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Pickups</b> are currently the go-to form of competitve environment for polish TF2 community.
        Pickups allow people to play on their chosen classes, with the player distribution to the teams done by automatic balance system.
        The only thing the player has to do is to log in on our website and choose his/her favourite class.
        When there is enough people signed up for the game, the system automatically balances the teams and sets up the server for game.
      </p>
      <p>In the past, so called "doublemixes" were played (remember PE lessons when the teams were chosen for a game and You
        were the fat kid? The odd one out? That's how competitive tf2 games looked like)
        Thankfully this is now a relict of the past, thanks to the  <i>tf2pickup.pl</i> system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MGE</b> tournament will bring to light the best Polish TF2 player. As this gamemode is most popular for soldiers, 
        the tournament will be restricted to this class only. MGE stands for <i>my gaming edge</i>, as it tests the actual limits of the player.
        The one and only factor affecting the outcome of competing in the gamemode is player's skill. During the tournament,
        players will duel 1v1 on specially crafted arenas, based on the most popular competitive maps.
        The winner of MGE torunament will be rewarded with a physical prize, which will remain unknown until the very end of the competition.

        Thanks to that, we have a possibility of renting a gaming rig to compete on fair grounds against the other players. BaseStack provides attendees with not only whole gaming rigs, but also peripherals.
        People who are used to playing with their favourite mouses and keyboards are welcome to take their own peripherals. The place is known for 
        its tournaments, hosted every weekend, that gain sizeable popularity on TikTok.

            Coming both from the northern and southern Poland by motorway A1, you should take exit nr 22 and head to the centre of Łódź. After exiting the motorway, turn right on the roundabout,
            heading towards Rokicińska street. Then, turn left and moving along Rokicińska street, you'll almost reach the very centre of Łódź. When coming closer to the town centre, we advise to use navigation systems to find the
            quickest way of reaching the destination.
          </p>
          <p>However, the location of the event place makes it hard to find a parking spot. If some extra help regarding that is needed, please reach out to wonszu#7366 @ discord.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: How much does it cost?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: 220 PLN for adults, 165PLN for minors, and for people who just want to spectate, without participating, the entrance is free.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: Łódź? Why?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: Because we have found a place that offers a lot of possibilities at little cost. We can rent PCs
        without worrying about having to transport our own rigs. Another advantage is the fact, that Łódź
        is located in the central region of Poland, and most of the people have direct way of reaching the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: WILL THERE BE MEDALS?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: Unfortunately, no. The closest thing we have to medals are pins - courtesy of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198401071677">Zuri</a>,
         and they look like <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/562893014457122816/975756680497344562/IMG_20220516_154824.png">this</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: Are there any parkings nearby?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: However, the location of the event place makes it hard to find a parking spot. If some extra help regarding that is needed, please reach out to wonszu#7366 @ discord.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: I only want to play 6v6/highlander. Can I?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: Sure, nobody is forced to play anything he does not want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: Can I buy a t-shirt?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: Sure enough! Take a look:
        <ul>
          <li>a jumper with PoLANd logo and your nick (<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537377650792988672/540603569745690626/20190131_193227.jpg">front</a>/<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537377650792988672/540603571176079360/20190131_193242.jpg">back</a>) - 120 PLN</li>
          <li>a t-shirt with PoLANd logo and your nick (<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537377650792988672/540603570547064852/20190131_193132.jpg">front</a>/<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537377650792988672/540603570547064853/20190131_193144.jpg">back</a>) - 75 PLN</li>
          <li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537377650792988672/540606335415222311/20190131_193810.jpg">t-shirt with lajba.tf logo</a> - the server administration of which is organising the tournament - 50 PLN</li>
        </ul>
        Place your orders at discord.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: What about accomodation? Is there any place to sleep?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: Sure, take a look at the <a href="#accomodation">accomodation</a> section above.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: Where can I sign up?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: First, you need to join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/UVFVfc4">discord</a>. Then, in the section named PoLANd, on the channel #poland-tf-faq you need to make a ticket. In the ticket you let us know you're willing to participate, and starting from there, we take care of the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Player</i>: I don't feel like playing. Can I drop in, watch some games and high five the participants?<br />
        <strong>supra</strong>: Sure! During previouse editions there were a bunch of participants like you and as far as I know they had as much fun as the next gamer.<br />
        One thing, tho: in case of space limitations (with <b>a lot</b> of potential participants), gamers with PCs will have higher priority.
